# FlashCards
## First Mod 2 Solo Project
## Project Overview
This was my first solo project for Mod 2 at Turing School of Software & Design

My objective was to solidify my understanding of class to class interaction and test driven design. Tests were created before functionality to figure out what components were required to achieve a text-only FlashCards style quiz game.
This was also an opportunity to use Github projects and issues to manage each step in the development process.

## Functionality
- Game is comprised of several interacting classes
- Game runs in the terminal and is text-only

## Instructions

To download the repository:
- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/ermatlock/flashcards) to your local machine
- `cd` into the project
- In the terminal, type `node index.js` to play


## Gameplay
- The user will be greeted with a text screen with the first question.
- Answer by typing the answer number and hit enter.
- You will get a message indicating whether your answer was correct or not.
